### Research pitch 
Please prepare a 3 min pitch of your research project. The pitch should cover the following points:
1) What is your research question?
2) What type of data do you use (intent to use)?
3) What type of model do you use (intent to use)?
4) What is the major challenge you are currently facing?
5) Are you plan to use ML? If yes: Why and how? If no: What limitation do you see?

We are planning to do the pitches Wednesday/Thursday after the Q&A session, as well Friday morning.
